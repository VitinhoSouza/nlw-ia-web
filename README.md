## Techs:
- **ReactJs**;

- **Tailwindcss** for styling;
- **Axios** for execute API requests;
- **ai** to use the useCompletion function and handle text completion and the state of prompt inputs;
- **lucide-react** for use of icons;
- **@radix-ui** for components implementation (label, select, separator etc.);
- **@ffmpeg** for convert video to audio.

## Get started:
- With Git installed, in your terminal run the following command: `git clone https://github.com/VitinhoSouza/nlw-ia-web.git`;
- Enter the project folder and do: `yarn install`. When all packages are installed, do `yarn vite` to start in development mode;
- To work correctly you must have a server running at `localhost:3333` serving your requests.
